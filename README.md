   ```

#### Retrieve All Vectors
   ```bash
   Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/vectors'
   ```

#### Retrieve a Specific Vector by ID
   ```bash
   Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/vector/vec1'
   ```

#### Delete a Vector by ID
   ```bash
   Invoke-RestMethod -Method DELETE -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/vector/vec1'
   ```

#### Sort Vectors
   ```bash
   Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri 'http://localhost:3000/vectors/sort/id'
   ```

#### Perform Vector Addition
   ```bash
